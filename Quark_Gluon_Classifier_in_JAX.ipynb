        "\n",
        "*   The `QuarkGluonClassifier` model was confirmed to be correctly defined using `flax.linen` components (Dense layers and ReLU activations) with a `hidden_dims` parameter, adhering to the specified architecture.\n",
        "*   The `binary_cross_entropy_loss` function and the JAX JIT-compiled `train_step` function were correctly implemented. Crucially, they were modified to pass `apply_fn` explicitly, resolving potential JAX tracing issues.\n",
        "*   The model and optimizer initialization (`TrainState` setup) was confirmed to be correctly pre-configured in an existing notebook cell, ensuring JAX compatibility by utilizing `apply_fn` rather than directly storing the model instance.\n",
        "*   Synthetic dummy training data was successfully generated, consisting of input features `x` with a shape of (32, 5) and binary labels `y` with a shape of (32, 1).\n",
        "*   The training loop was successfully modified to print the training loss every 10 steps for a total of 100 steps. The training loss demonstrated a clear decreasing trend, starting from approximately 0.0751 at step 10 and concluding at 0.0142 at step 100.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The consistent decrease in training loss indicates that the model is learning effectively on the dummy data. This proof of concept demonstrates that the core training components (model, loss, optimizer, and training step) are correctly integrated and functional.\n",
        "*   The next logical step is to integrate real-world Quark-Gluon jet dataset for training and validation to evaluate the model's performance on actual experimental data and assess its generalization capabilities.\n"
